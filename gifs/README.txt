DROP YOUR GIFs HERE
===================

Save exactly these 2 files in this folder:

  correct.gif   —  shown when the player answers correctly
  wrong.gif     —  shown when the player answers wrong or times out

The GIF will appear large (320×320 px) centered on screen,
pop-in with a bounce, hold for ~1.5 s, then fade out.

Correct GIF gets a green glow, Wrong GIF gets a red glow.

Good free sources:
  - GIPHY (giphy.com)       — search "celebrate", "happy dance", "yes"
                              and "sad", "fail", "oops", "wrong"
  - Tenor (tenor.com)       — same searches
  - Search and download     — right-click the GIF → Save Image As

Tips:
  - Looping GIFs with a transparent background look best
  - Square or near-square GIFs fill the frame better
  - Keep file size under ~3 MB for fast loading
